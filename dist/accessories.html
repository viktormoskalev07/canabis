They are generally used to wrap the cannabis flower into a smokable format.</br></br> Pre rolled cones are gaining in popularity because they are so convenient!</br></br> When you use a pre rolled cone, all you do is remove the cannabis pre rolled cone from the packaging, take out your cannabis flower, and fill the pre rolled cone with the cannabis flower.</br></br> And voila, you’ve got a ready to go cannabis joint!</br></br> Filters are popular because they help smokers maintain a clean and ash free experience during their smoking session</br></br> For the veteran cannabis consumer, they probably are used to using cardboard cutouts as filters, but with all the new options on the market, there’s no need to go back to the old days!</br></br> Now, many rolling papers come complete with filters as well, so you can kill two birds with one stone by buying rolling papers with filters inside.</p>

            <p class="section-accessories__text">How do you use grinders and what are they meant for?</br></br> Grinders are a staple cannabis accessory for most cannabis consumers and we’ve got plenty in stock!</br></br> Cannabis grinders help you break down the cannabis flower into tiny pieces that are much easier to roll up into a joint or a spliff.</br></br> There are all sorts of different types of grinders, from 4 piece cylindrical grinders to grinders that look like a visa card and function much like a cheese grater. All the user has to do is grind the flower on the side of the card, and you’ve got perfectly sized pieces of cannabis flower to use to roll up into a joint.</br></br> It makes smoking a breeze! And that’s why so many cannabis consumers rely on grinders, carrying them with them wherever they go, which is easy to do when they are as small as a visa card!</p>
