                                                 There are numerous ways to consume cannabis, but one of the most popular formats right now are cannabis edibles.</br></br> Edibles have been around for a long time, but cannabis users are becoming more health conscious now and are looking for more smoke free alternatives to dried cannabis flower.</br></br> This is why edibles are showing up in more and more Toronto dispensaries and why Toronto Cannabis Authority carries a wide selection of cannabis edibles in our Toronto cannabis store.

            <p class="section-accessories__text">Cannabis edibles are an exciting new way to enjoy cannabis in Toronto.</br></br> With the legalization of cannabis in Canada, edibles are now legal to consume. Some people consume them for recreational purposes, some because they believe it will reduce pain, some believe it will increase focus, and others just to have a better experience smoking cannabis. Cannabis edibles have become one of the most popular ways to consume cannabis. </br></br> There are many new cannabis edibles on the market, including gummies, chocolates, and baked goods like cookies. When you think about eating cannabis food, it’s easy to fall into the mindset of “these things are bad for you!” The truth is, cannabis food is one of the most versatile and delicious ways to consume cannabis. And, if you are new to edibles, it can be easy to be risk-adverse eating fewer doses or in lesser quantities.</br></br> Currently in Canada, the limit per package of edibles is restricted to 10MG of THC but everyone expects that will go up in the future and we’ll see more and more unique products!</br></br> Toronto Cannabis Authority sells government regulated and licensed cannabis edibles. Our products are overseen by Health Canada and certified to ensure that they are safe for consumption which is a huge benefit over illicit market cannabis edible products</p>

            <p class="section-accessories__text">Making good edibles is a lot easier than it used to be, but gummies are a whole other story!</br></br> Most people have access to equipment and ingredients needed to make their own cannabis infused food. The only thing left is choosing which food product you should make.</br></br> But when it comes to cannabis gummies, there’s a real advantage to buying legal market products because with the onset of legalization, cannabis companies are now investing heavily into the research and development of these products.</br></br> There are so many new types of gummies, from CBD gummies that don’t have any intoxicating effects, to high THC gummies which give the user the type of mind altering effects that most “high THC” seekers are looking for.</br></br> The range of flavors, textures and sizes of cannabis gummies have really developed over the past several years and we’re sure to stock the ones you love at Toronto Cannabis Authority!</br></br> Let us know what kinds of gummies you’re interested in, what effect you want to achieve from your cannabis purchase, and we’ll help make it a reality.</p>

            <p class="section-accessories__text">Generally speaking, when someone refers to low dose cannabis, they are referring to a product or format that has a small amount of THC, and quite often contains a high amount of CBD. For example, a cannabis cookie with 1MG of THC and 10MG of CBD would be considered a low dose edible, whereas a cannabis gummy with 10MG of THC and 0MG of CBD would be considered a high dose edible.</br></br> Among the fastest growing cannabis formats in the world, low dose edibles can be found at our Toronto store and make a great purchase, or gift idea, for any novice cannabis consumer, or anyone looking to achieve a relaxing effect without getting too “high”. From low dose cannabis chocolates, to low dose gummies, to low dose THC beverages, also known as micro dose beverages, Toronto Cannabis Authority is sure to have the low dose THC or high CBD.</p>
