            <p class="section-accessories__text">For ages, Canadians have been used to the idea of cracking open a cold beer on the cottage dock when summer hits, but cannabis beverages are changing that into something else!</br></br> Low dose THC drinks are becoming enormously popular with people who are looking to replace alcohol because of the very obvious and well documented negative effects associated with alcohol.</br></br> These drinks are part of a new trend calling microdosing, which is when a person consumes a small amount of an intoxicating substance like cannabis and THC. Micro dose drinks are generally considered to be cannabis beverages with less than 2.5MG of THC per can or per bottle.</br></br> Generally, these drinks also have a high amount of CBD in them as well to help offset the effects of the THC.</p>

            <p class="section-accessories__text">CBD drinks are one of the fastest growing formats in the cannabis world because they are making cannabis accessible to scores of new consumers!</br></br> Many people have shied away from cannabis because they believe THC is too intoxicating, either from things they’ve heard through the grapevine, or because of a previous bad experience.</br></br> Although lots of people can consume THC without experiencing any negative effects, there are many people who report feelings of paranoia when they consume too much high THC cannabis.</br></br>  And the reason why CBD beverages are becoming	so popular is because those people who are fearful of the paranoia effects associated with THC will have nothing to worry about if they consume CBD.</br></br> CBD is not known to produce any intoxicating effects which means that users do not experience paranoia, but they do get to experience the benefits of cannabis.</br></br> Many brands are now coming out with unique cannabis drinks that only contain CBD and serving this specific market. For example, there are many different types of CBD teas, CBD infused sparkling waters, sodas, and other beverages on the market right now!</p>
