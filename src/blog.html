<h3>Let Toronto Cannabis Authority Help You Plan Your Evenings Out</h3>



<p>Over the last couple of years, times have changed dramatically. We’ve all been forced to rethink the ways that we plan to get out of the house and socialize. While the inevitable return of stadium and arena events like sports and concerts will eventually lead to more indoor festivities, for the time being, we all have to find other ways to engage ourselves.<br><br>That’s never truer than when we’re smoking bowls of our favourite cannabis buds. Staying inside all the time can drive anyone crazy, and Toronto has plenty of ways to safely enjoy your time outdoors.<br>Apart from the best indica or sativa strains around, Toronto Cannabis Authority also has a lot of helpful ideas that you can use to plan your next night out. So, we’ve put together a list of a few of our favourite local outdoor venues for you to enjoy.</p>



<h3>Sugar Beach</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="886" height="464" src="http://wpcannabis/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SugarBeach.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-113" srcset="http://wpcannabis/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SugarBeach.jpg 886w, http://wpcannabis/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SugarBeach-300x157.jpg 300w, http://wpcannabis/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SugarBeach-768x402.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px"></figure>



<p>Being built on Lake Ontario, Toronto has a lot of interesting history when it comes to trade and industrial manufacturing. Sugar Beach is the beautiful redeveloped, man-made beach that now stands where there was once a parking lot for one of these industrial complexes.<br><br>This stunning view of the waterfront is the perfect way to enjoy a lazy afternoon sprawled out on the sand in the sun, watching the boats on the water. Maybe bring your vape pen with you when you go, and add a little extra kick to your day.<br><br>This welcoming outdoor venue is a perfect testament to the fact that Toronto is a constantly evolving city; not afraid to grow and change alongside its communities.</p>

<h2>High Park</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="886" height="464" src="http://wpcannabis/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HighPark.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-116" srcset="http://wpcannabis/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HighPark.jpg 886w, http://wpcannabis/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HighPark-300x157.jpg 300w, http://wpcannabis/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HighPark-768x402.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px"></figure>



<p>How could we talk about incredible outdoor venues without talking about High Park?<br>Long before cannabis was ever legalized in Canada, this was a place that cannabis users felt safe to come and smoke bowls or a joint, without fear of being accosted. The sheer size of this gorgeous park makes it a perfect choice for your post-smoke walk, since you won’t have to worry about bothering anyone who doesn’t use or appreciate cannabis.<br><br>Much like Trinity Bellwoods Park (we’ll get to that in a bit), High Park offers a superb view when the cherry blossoms appear every spring.<br><br>In the winter, High Park also has a wonderful outdoor skating rink, so don’t forget to bring your skates and stick. You might be able to jump in on a game, or start one yourself!</p>

<h2>Toronto Zoo</h2>

The zoo is huge, and there’s a good chance you won’t be able to see everything in a single day.<br><br>But that’s okay!

<h2>Trinity Bellwoods Park</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="886" height="464" src="http://wpcannabis/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TrinityBellwoodsPark.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-121" srcset="http://wpcannabis/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TrinityBellwoodsPark.jpg 886w, http://wpcannabis/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TrinityBellwoodsPark-300x157.jpg 300w, http://wpcannabis/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TrinityBellwoodsPark-768x402.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px"></figure>



<p>Apart from the incredibly nice dog park that Trinity Bellwoods Park provides to the Toronto communities, it’s a frequent host for local art fairs and food festivals. So, after you smoke a bowl, you can take your pup for a walk and maybe grab a bite or take in a little culture.<br><br>In the springtime, this park is absolutely stunning to visit because of the cherry blossoms that create a wonderfully striking contrast to the city skyline on the horizon. In the summer, Movie Night in the Park provides a pleasant, outdoor evening entertainment for cinema fanatics of all ages.<br><br>Did we mention the farmer’s market?! That’s right. Local, sustainable, naturally grown, organic products sold by members of our own Toronto community. It’s the perfect place to support local.</p>
