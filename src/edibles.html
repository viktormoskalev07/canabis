    text:"Cannabis edibles are an exciting new way to enjoy cannabis in Toronto.</br></br> With the legalization of cannabis in Canada, edibles are now legal to consume. Some people consume them for recreational purposes, some because they believe it will reduce pain, some believe it will increase focus, and others just to have a better experience smoking cannabis. Cannabis edibles have become one of the most popular ways to consume cannabis. </br></br> There are many new cannabis edibles on the market, including gummies, chocolates, and baked goods like cookies. When you think about eating cannabis food, it’s easy to fall into the mindset of “these things are bad for you!” The truth is, cannabis food is one of the most versatile and delicious ways to consume cannabis. And, if you are new to edibles, it can be easy to be risk-adverse eating fewer doses or in lesser quantities.</br></br> Currently in Canada, the limit per package of edibles is restricted to 10MG of THC but everyone expects that will go up in the future and we’ll see more and more unique products!</br></br> Toronto Cannabis Authority sells government regulated and licensed cannabis edibles. Our products are overseen by Health Canada and certified to ensure that they are safe for consumption which is a huge benefit over illicit market cannabis edible products",
