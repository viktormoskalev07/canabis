When recreational legalization of cannabis began, other people started to flock to CBD as well.",

It’s completely incorrect to believe that the “best” cannabis is the highest THC cannabis.</br></br> In fact, many people have an extremely low tolerance to cannabis and cannot tolerate high THC products, but they believe in the benefits of cannabis and want to consume products that suit them. That’s why so many people are switching to CBD products like CBD oils.</br></br> Generally, these people choose options that are high in CBD but extremely low in THC, to the point that there can be virtually no effect from the THC.</br></br> Others like to find a more balanced oil, commonly known as a 1:1 (one to one) which offers an equal mix of CBD and THC. For example, a cannabis oil which has 10MG of CBD and 10MG of THC is referred to as a 1:1.",
