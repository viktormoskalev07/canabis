                              In a city as diverse as Toronto, it's easy to get lost in the shuffle and lose sight of
                              what’s truly
                              special
                              about this city.

                              We think that Toronto and cannabis go hand in hand so we wanted to combine the two and
                              create Toronto
                              Cannabis Authority, not just another cannabis store in Toronto, but an homage to the
                              city. We opened our
                              flagship store at the beginning of 2021 in the heart of Toronto, near the intersection
                              of Queen Street
                              and
                              University. Come visit us today at 229 Queen St W!

                              For years, the Toronto Cannabis community has been an enormous part of the city and it’s
                              been a
                              community
                              where members can come together and enjoy the many different aspects of cannabis.
